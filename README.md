## Inspiration

FinQuest was born from the need to make financial literacy engaging and practical for young people. Traditional financial education is often theoretical and dry, so we envisioned a platform that uses interactive storytelling and real-life scenarios to empower users with the skills needed to manage their finances effectively.

## What It Does

- **Interactive Learning:** Presents users with realistic financial scenarios where each decision impacts their virtual savings.
- **Dynamic Decision Trees:** Visualizes user choices in a dynamic decision tree that shows the long-term impact of each decision.
- **User Profiles & Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and view their personalized financial journey.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Each decision comes with an explanation and a calculated effect on the user's virtual money, making the learning experience practical and engaging.

## How We Built It

- **Frontend:**  
  Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a modern, responsive user interface.

- **Backend:**  
  Developed using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (via Mongoose) to manage user data, decision trees, and authentication.

- **Authentication:**  
  Implemented secure user authentication using JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) along with password hashing using bcrypt.

- **API Integration:**  
  RESTful API endpoints connect the frontend to the backend, ensuring a smooth, interactive user experience.

## Challenges We Ran Into

- **Dynamic Decision Tree Visualization:**  
  Creating a data structure that dynamically represents user decisions and building a clear, intuitive UI to visualize these decision trees was complex.

- **CORS & API Integration:**  
  Configuring cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) between the Next.js frontend and Express backend required careful setup.

- **Secure Authentication:**  
  Implementing JWT-based authentication while ensuring data security and proper session management posed additional challenges.
